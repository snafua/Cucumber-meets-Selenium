                    <p><b>BootsFaces is targeted at Java EE 6/7 and requires a Java 1.6 or later VM.</b></p>
                    <p><b>JSF 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 are supported.</b></p>
                    <p><b>Oracle Mojarra 2.2+ or Apache MyFaces 2.2+</b></p>
                    <p class="text-warning">Note1: Oracle has dropped Commercial support for Glassfish as of version 4.0. Glassfish will therefore be only the Reference Implementation for Java EE.<br />
                    BootsFaces is therefore first tested for compliance in Glassfish, then tested on other Application Servers such as WildFly/JBoss and TomEE.</p>
                    <p class="text-warning">Note2: Glassfish 3.2 is installed with an old version of the JSF library(2.1.6) with a known bug fixed in version 2.1.8.
                                            we suggest you to update the library to the latest version.</p></div>
